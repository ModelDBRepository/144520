This model reproduces the cardiac action potentials and pacemaker
activity of a mammalian cell of the sinoatrial node.

It is based on the paper by :

DiFrancesco D & Noble D (1985) A model of cardiac electrical activity
incorporating ionic pumps and concentration changes.
Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B 307:353-398
[<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2578676" target='url'

It was the first model to incorporate the external and internal
concentration changes and has been very influential in directing
modeling efforts.

To run the simulation auto-launch the model from modeldb or download
and extract the archive and then compile the mod files under:

unix/linux:
-----------
type nrnivmodl in the DiFrancescoNoble1985 folder and then
nrngui mosinit.hoc

mswin:
------
run mknrndll and then double click on mosinit.hoc

MAC OS X:
--------
Drag and drop the DiFrancescoNoble1985 folder onto the mknrndll icon.  
Drag and drop the mosinit.hoc file onto the nrngui icon.

Once the simulation starts it recreates the Fig. 6 of the original
paper:
